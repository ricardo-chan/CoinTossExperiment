# CoinTossExperiment
Simulation for flipping virtual fair coins, as per the Learning From Data course.

### What I learned:

* Used random library to generate simulation for coin flip.
* Learned about list comprehensions to implement algorithm.
* Implemented Monte Carlo method to get probability distribution for coin flips.

Used as an exercise to further comprehend concepts seen in [Learning From Data Course](http://book.caltech.edu/bookforum/index.php).
